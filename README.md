 ML Workflow Pipeline
The Machine Learning Workflow Pipeline followed in this project consists of the following stages:
## HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING THE LINEAR REGRESSION
 ## Problem Definition
Understand the objective: Predict house prices based on input features.

## 2. Data Collection
Load dataset (e.g., from CSV, Kaggle).

Identify features and target variable.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (e.g., using mean/median imputation).

Convert categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).

Feature scaling (optional for linear regression).

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize feature distributions.

Use correlation heatmaps to identify strong predictors.

Detect and handle outliers.

## 5. Feature Selection
Remove irrelevant or redundant features.

Use domain knowledge or statistical methods (like correlation, VIF).

## 6. Model Selection and Training
Choose Linear Regression.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the model on training data.

## 7. Model Evaluation
Use metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ².

Visualize actual vs predicted results.

## 8. Model Deployment
Package the model using pickle or joblib.

Serve it using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
Real estate price estimation is critical for buyers, sellers, and developers.
The goal is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression that can accurately estimate the selling price of a house based on features like area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, and other amenities.

## Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
 Why Linear Regression?
Simple, fast, and interpretable.
Effective when the relationship between input variables and target is approximately linear.
Good baseline model for regression problems.
LINEAR REGRESSION PREDICTS THE OUTPUT WITH ONE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WITH ONE OR MORE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
